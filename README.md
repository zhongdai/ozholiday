A simple function to check a given date a public holiday or not in Australia, really easy to use.

- Use the data from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/australian-holidays-machine-readable-dataset)
- Only use Python standard libraries
- Only one function - keep it simple
- Save a `json` file to local, and get a new file if the cached file is more than 180 old
